## Abstract

- This project addresses the under-utilization of free SMS quotas provided to users by proposing an application that benefits both businesses and individual users. The system leverages unused SMS quotas by securely matching users with businesses needing SMS services. Through a database, the app assigns users to send encrypted SMS messages on behalf of businesses, ensuring secure and efficient communication. Recipients can decrypt messages into plain text using the app, enhancing both functionality and resource utilization. The proposed system not only optimizes unused SMS quotas but also provides a practical and secure solution for businesses to engage in cost-effective communication.

## Motivation
- Many mobile users receive free SMS quotas as part of their plans, but a significant portion of these quotas often goes unused, leading to wasted resources. On the other hand, the demand for SMS persists despite the prevalence of modern messaging applications. SMS remains essential for scenarios such as service notifications, account verifications, and other time-critical communications.
This project aims to bridge these two needs by proposing a system that matches users with unused SMS quotas to businesses looking for cost-effective ways to send SMS messages. On one side, users can leverage their free SMS quo- tas to gain incentives such as discounts on registrations or restaurant coupons. On the other side, businesses benefit by accessing an affordable SMS distribution channel. This symbiotic relationship not only reduces wasted resources but also adds value for both parties.

# 2024 Fall PCS Final-Project

This project addresses the under-utilization of free SMS quotas provided to users by proposing an application that benefits both businesses and individual users. The system leverages unused SMS quotas by securely matching users with businesses needing SMS services. Through a database, the app assigns users to send encrypted SMS messages on behalf of businesses, ensuring secure and efficient communication. Recipients can decrypt messages into plain text using the app, enhancing both functionality and resource utilization. The proposed system not only optimizes unused SMS quotas but also provides a practical and secure solution for businesses to engage in cost-effective communication.
